## Analysis of Olympic Games Athlets' Data for past 120 years

For **the first Project** I was dealing with some data for *athlets participated in the Olympic Games during the past 120 years*. This is an educational/practice project coded with mostly python `pandas` package. For data visualization I used `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `statannot` packages. For statistics I applied `scipy` package. 

During the Project1, I solved this Tasks:

- combined the observations into a single dataframe with the custom function `gen_df()`;
- performed EDA for our data and "fixed the bugs';
- obtained some Athlets' and Games' information according to particular Task;
- performed Athlets' Height standartization using z-scores and min-max normalization;
- checked some hypothesis
