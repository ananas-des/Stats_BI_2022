## Linear models for Boston Housing Data

For **the second Project** I tried to build and chracterize linear regression model to evaluate which features mostly impact on *house prices in Boston in 1970-1980th*. During this educational/practice project python `pandas` module was used to process data. For data visualization `matplotlib` and `seaborn` modules were used. For linear regression modeling and its evaluation `statsmodel` module functions were applied. 

Using resulted linear regression model, I have formulated some recommendations for entrepreneurs abd builders in Boston in 1970-1980th (maybe for nowadays, too):

- **build as close as possible to the employment centers of the city**;

- **build in the towns with larger houses with higher average room count**;

- **avoid towns with high share of low status population. The lower, the beter. Or at least lower than 5%**;

- build in towns with lower pupil-teacher ration, preferably lower than 17;

- build in areas with better air quality, with lower level of nitric oxide related to fuel combustion and car traffic


### Files

There are **two files** in this folder. Here some discriptions of them.

- [README.md](./README.md): discriptions for Priject2 and files in this directory;
- [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt): .txt file with the dependencies


### Folders

- [data_folder](./data_folder): contains .csv file with [data](./data_folder/BostonHousing.csv) and .txt file with [descriptions](./data_folder/features_description.txt) for features;
- [report_folder](./report_folder): Project2 Report in three formats - [.html](./report_folder/report_boston_housing_project.html), [.ipynb](./report_folder/report_boston_housing_project.ipynb), and [.py](./report_folder/report_boston_housing_project.py)

### System

This Project was done on *Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS* with *Python version 3.10.6*
